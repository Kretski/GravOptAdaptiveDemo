# Patent Notice

The core algorithm implemented in this repository —  
**"Adaptive Fine-Grain Parameter Freezing Based on Gradient Statistics for Energy-Efficient Neural Network Training"** —  
is the subject of a pending patent application.

## 🔒 Protected Elements
The following technical innovations are protected:
- Dynamic freezing threshold calculated as a percentile of the median absolute gradient
- Per-parameter activity state (`h`) enabling fine-grain freeze/unfreeze control
- Tanh-based adaptive unfreezing mechanism responsive to gradient magnitude
- Warm-up phase with no freezing to ensure training stability
- Energy-efficient update skipping based on activity state

## ⚠️ Usage Rights
- ✅ **Allowed**: Academic research, personal experimentation, non-commercial evaluation
- ❌ **Prohibited**: Commercial deployment, product integration, redistribution in commercial products

## 💼 Commercial Licensing
This demo is provided for evaluation purposes only.  
**Any commercial use requires a formal license agreement.**
